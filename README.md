# moviefinder
This live coding session revisits the Siskel exercise created earlier in the program to build a Sinatra-based web app. This app, MovieFinder, will allow users to search for movies and retrieve basic information about them.

Upon completion, we will be able to structure files in our Sinatra application and use ERB to embed Ruby code into our HTML.
